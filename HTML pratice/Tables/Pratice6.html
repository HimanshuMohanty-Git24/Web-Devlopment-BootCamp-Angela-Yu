            Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you
            click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video
            you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for
            the video that best fits your document. To make your document look
            professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page,
            and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you
            can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and
            then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
            <br /><br />
            Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you
            click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and
            SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply
            styles, your headings change to match the new theme. Save time in
            Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change
            the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for
            layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click
            where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus
            sign.
